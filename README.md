# Machine-Learning-Session-3
Excercise on Imbalanced datasets on a credit fraud case

### Summary
In this session I am trying to implement hyper parameter tuning using K-Fold cross validation

### In Detail
We will be working with a dataset that, while synthetic, closely resembles real-world data in structure and complexity. 
It includes both numerical and categorical features, presenting a common scenario in data analysis and machine learning tasks. This dataset comprises records of individuals who have obtained loans from a bank.

The model that I use in order to proceed with the analysis is a Random Forest, where I used K-Fold cross validation in order to tune the various hyper parameters of the momdel

### Objectives
Understand and Prepare the Data: Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
Develop a Baseline Model: To benchmark our improvements.
Implement Imbalance Handling Techniques: Including resampling and algorithm adjustments.
Evaluate Model Performance: Using Cross Validation on a Random Forest suited.
